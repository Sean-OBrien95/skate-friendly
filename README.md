# Skate Friendly

Skate Friendly is a site that that is aimed at people who have recently started skating and want to join a community group to skate with, or people who are interested in starting skating based in Dublin, Ireland. This website aims to help them by showing them how to do basic tricks, showing them times and places they can meet other skaters, recommending equipment and safety tips, as well as allowing them to get in contact with the group directly.

Skate Friendly is ultimately a one stop website that will have all the crucial information for beginner skaters to get more comfortable on skates and show them all the crucial information they will need to know such as how to stay safe.

# Features

In this section I will be covering the various features I have implemented, who I had in mind when creating them, and why they are useful. This project will have a total of 6 html sheets, as well as a css sheet. There will be a html for the Home page, the Tricks page, the FAQ page, the Contact page, as well as one Thank You page and 404 Error page.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

## Colour Scheme



### Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar and logo

Featured on all six pages, the navigation bar which will always appear at the top of the page features a link to the home page, a link to the tricks page, one to the faq page, and one for the contact page.
This was created to help the user flow of the website and allow the user to jump between each section at will without having to rely on back commands from the browser. The logo also acts as a home button if the user would like to use that.

- Hero image and text

The hero image was designed to make the introduction the website instantly recognisable. The image is pair of skates with a brief description of what the page is about, so that the user does not question the purpose of the website
