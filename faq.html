                    You wont be expected to skate on anything gravely, go off road, or skate along a trail, so don't

                    equipment, but we can't guarantee you will be able to skate. There will be plenty of people there to
                    socialise with and get tips off if you are curious about skating and if someone has equipment they
                    might let you use there's for a while, but always make sure to ask!

                <hr>
                <p>We always recommend wearing a full set of safetly gear when you are learning to Skate.
                    This includes kneepads, elbowpads, and a set of wrist guards. You can also wear a helmet if you
                    choose. This items are designed to protect you when you fall and are mandatory for coming to the
                    meetups, so make sure to pick yours up <a

                <hr>
                <p>Falling is a part of skating that we all encounter, so what we'll show you during the meetups is how
                    to reduce damage for when you do fall. For beginners, we always recommend going slow, skating with
                    hands forward so you break you're fall, and staying close to other experienced skaters who will be
                    able to help.

                    proper technique. If you do become injured though, someone from the team will be able to provide
                    first-aid and carry a box of medical supplies with us at all time. But keep in mind, this is not
                    something we predict happening!

                <hr>
                <p>There are a variety of skates to pick and choose from, and we have a couple of recommendations! Some
                    of the best brand you can buy are Rookie, Ridel, and Rio. These are all trusted brands and great for
                    first-timers! Of all of these though we would recommend Rookie the most, as they are very beginner
                    friendly as the name suggests! You can browse and pick some up <a

                    a popular brand known as impala. We do not recommend these skates as they are designed with visual
                    styling as a priority over pracricallity.

                    essential but can make certain aspects like transporation easier or give you a look that suits your

                <hr>
                <p>When you are starting out, the wheels that come with your skates should be more than enough to get
                    you going. However, once you start getting a little more advanced these can be something to
                    consider. We recommend when picking up a new set of wheels to go for something slightly wider than
                    what will come with your skates, ideally over 60mm diameter. This will give you more control. You
                    can get different types of wheels such as ones better suited to indoors and ones better suited to
                    outdoors, so make sure to keep this in mind! You can browse some <a
