Project title: Skate friendly

Description: This is my first project that will be done through the Code Institute focused on HTML5 and CSS3.
The aim of this project is to create a website for a skating community group that is focused arounf beginners.
This will give information on meetups, safetly tips, beginner tricks, brands and products, and include photograph and videos.
This will have a CSS page and 4 HTML pages for Home, Tricks, Safety and FAQs, and a questionaire.

The goal will be to make this website user friendly and accessable. To do this, I will create a clear flow of information on
the website and will be making it readable.

The colours that I plan to use in this are grey for text, white for background, and green for highlighted information.

I will start by creating the first HTML page which will be the home page. On this page will feature general information about
the group, some photographs, and details of the meetups. This will also include a navigation header, which will be present on all
HTML documents.

Next, I will create my CSS sheet, I will use this to style my various HTML sheets.

I will then create 3 more HTML sheets, one for tricks, which will include descriptions of each trick, how to do them, photos,
and videos for reference.

The next HTML sheet will include information on safety, FAQs, and recommended products and brands. This will include photos
and links.

The final HTML sheet will be a questionaire/registration that will include a multiple choice selection asking how long they have 
been skating, how they found out about the group, and what age group they are in.
