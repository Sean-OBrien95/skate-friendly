Project title: Skate friendly

Description: This is my first project that will be done through the Code Institute focused on HTML5 and CSS3.
The aim of this project is to create a website for a skating community group that is focused around beginners.
This will give information on meetups, safetly tips, beginner tricks, brands and products, and include photograph and videos.
This will have a CSS page and 4 HTML pages for Home, Tricks, Safety and FAQs, and a contact questionaire that will take you to a thank you page when complete..

The goal will be to make this website user friendly and accessable. To do this, I will create a clear flow of information on
the website and will be making it readable.

I started by creating the first HTML page is the home page. This page features general information about
the group, a hero image, and details of the meetups. This also includes a navigation header, which will be present on all
HTML documents.

I then created 3 more HTML sheets, one for tricks, which will include descriptions of each trick, how to do them, a hero image,
and videos for reference.

The next HTML sheet will include information on safety, FAQs, and recommended products and brands. This will include a hero image
and links.

The final HTML sheet is a questionaire/registration that includes a multiple choice selection asking how long you have 
been skating. This page will also take you to a redirect thank you page.

Design choices:

Home: 

I had initally created the hero image on my home page with some text and a zoom effect. Originally, this was going to be the only page 
with a hero image but decided for consistency it would look better if each page had there own, bar the thank you page.
I had initally done a mix of background and img tags, but felt using a background for all would be better.

For the hero image, I decided on a pastel colour of skates as I felt this made what the page was about instantly recognisable.

The colours that I initally planned to use in this are grey for text, white for background, and green for highlighted information.
I changed this the green for highlight fairly early on in design, as I felt a pale blue colour suited the imagery better.

I had styled the logo and nav bar to go on every page. Initially, I had the logo centered on the page, but thought it would better
over at the left-hand corner. I also designed the logo as a link that would take you back to the home page. All options
on the nav menu also have a border line appear underneath to clearly show which page you are about to click,
while this is always present under the page you are on currently.

I had decided to design 3 columns for the Home page as I felt this was an easily digestable way to view
all the presented content. This was used again on the FAQ page in 3 seperate rows.

I then designed the meetup section below. This was designed to show 3 different environments to represent the different
skate locations. It also includes times, days, and locations.

The footer was designed to show evenly spaced links to social media pages. They all take you 
to the home page of each platform.

Tricks: 

I wanted to design this section in a way that would not be overwhelming to the user,
so for this page I created a single column style where they could view each trick,
with them getting progressively more difficult as you go further down.

None of them play automatically and once played you can control volume.

FAQ:

The FAQ section is broken down into 3 sections: FAQ, Safety, and Equipment. Each of these are then
further broken down into 3 pieces of information, displayed horizontally.

The FAQ section includes a link that will take you to the contact page, and the Safety and Equipment sections
take you to a new page by opening a new link to view products.

Contact:

This page is a contact/registration form. On this page I designed a simple form that is easy to use.
I had styled this by creating clear, rounded borders and then applying a shadow effect to clearly see the content.
I had also removed the tags outside the boxes and had what the form required inside the form elements
that disappear when you start to type.

I had then created a radio dial with multiple choices for you to select how long you have been skating.

Finally, I created a submit button that changes colour when hovered over to match the overall
colour scheme. 

All pages have been designed with media queries for responsiveness

Bugs:

My first bug was getting the hero image to fit correctly, this was solved by setting the background size to cover 
and the background position to center to get it to display correctly. I had also changed the size of the image to a smaller one.
Prior to this, the background was focused on parts of the photo that looked irrelavent to the content.

The second bug I encountered was when I was adding the videos to my tricks page. The content was overlapping with my footer and
took up a lot of space on the page. I realised I had set a very short height for my videos to fit into which made it overlap with the footer.
When I removed the height, it started to work as expected.

The third bug I cam across was when I was designing the FAQ page. One of the links in the footer was appearing 
far higher on the page then the rest. On some examination, the reason for this was I had not properly closed one of my tags.
Once this was fixed the footer was behaving as expected.

The fourth bug I encountered was when I was starting to take responsiveness into consideration.
I had my logo pushed over to the center of the page through padding and knew this would not work for responsiveness.
I also noticed that if it was centered this would negatively effect the nav menu as they would overlap.
I fixed this by moving my logo over to the left hand side using a float.

The fifth bug I came across was when I decided to change the image on my Tricks page. The image was appearing totally blank
but upon closer examination I had realised I had entered the wrong file path. Once I fixed this, it was working as expected.
