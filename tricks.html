            <h1>Your Introduction to tricks!</h1>
            <p>In this section we'll be showing you some of the basic tricks to get you started!
                We know learning tricks can seem like an intimidating task when you're only starting out,
                which is why we've selected the below ones very carefully,
                all of these tricks have been designed with beginners in mind are great to try
                once you've found your balance on the skate!

            <h2>The Bubble</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The bubble is a great first trick to learn as it teaches you the
                basics of how your feet and legs are supposed to move in the skates.
                You want to start this move by having your feet point outwards ar a 90 degree angel.
                Once there, you want to push your legs outwards, and once you reach full extension, guide your feet
                back inwards, completing the bubble. You can try play around with this, and try doing it backwards like
                the below when you feel comfortable!</p>

            <h2>Transitions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Transitioning is a very useful technique and even one that most advanced skaters
                build off of when doing other tricks! As the name implies, this move will allow you to transistion
                from a front facing position to a back facing one. There are many ways to do this, but the best to learn
                first is the one shown in the video below is the two step. To do this, you will balance on one leg, turn
                your body outwards, and then lift the other foot and turn it around to meet the first one. We recommend
                trying this standing still before doing it with movement!

            <h2>Skating Backwards</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Once you've built up some confidence, it might be a good time to try going backwards! This is a great
                trick
                that always looks impressive, no matter what your level is. To do this, you'll have to get comfortable
                with
                the bubble trick shown above. Escencially, you'll want to do a backwards bubble continously to start,
                once you feel
                comforable doing this, you can start trying to do a bubble using only one foot at a time, like the video
                below.
                Then you'll alternate which foot you're doing the backwards bubble with, and voila! you're skating
                backwards!
                And don't worry if you don't get this straight away, this move can take some time!
